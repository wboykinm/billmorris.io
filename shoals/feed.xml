        <description>
          
          Mapbox is occasionally referred to - not uncharitably - as ‚ÄúThe Tile Company‚Äù. It‚Äôs true; we deal with big amounts of data, and the most common map/reduce unit we use is the old standby Mercator/XYZ tile. My past and present colleagues have built some really cool tools to make these...

        <description>
          
          Yesterday a friend asked for my help hauling his boat closer to shore, along Lake Champlain in the Northern part of town. The recent flooding elsewhere in Vermont had now reached the lake, and he was worried that the rising waters would carry off his summer recreation plans. So I...

        <description>
          
          Summer is great. I keep forgetting this, but the shores of Lake Champlain - for a blessed few months every year - are an absolute paradise. As I biked with my son to his summer camp this morning, I saw it in full display: boats on the water, strolling couples,...

          Oh check it out - another middle-aged man on a bike, clad in lycra, spouting opinions. sigh. Now that I‚Äôve been forced to ditch running, I‚Äôve started cycling. Late in a Vermont winter, this has meant ponying up for a trainer attachment, plugging my old cross bike into it, and...

          It‚Äôs late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner. This year it‚Äôs harder than ever. My right...

          Y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve wandered over to Mastodon from Twitter, along with a goodly number of other folks from the broad geo-sphere, and it‚Äôs . . . nice. Feel easier to post random musings. Less motive, less image. But I rolled back over to Twitter right quick when I wanted to get...

It wasn‚Äôt really true; the room was well-heated and there‚Äôs nothing but a comforter, reinforcing the fact that I sleep best in the cold. On the flip side, it‚Äôs impossible to complain because thanks to the over-powered...

But we mostly use SQL. SQL is...
