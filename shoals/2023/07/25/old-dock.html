<p>Yesterday a friend asked for my help hauling his boat closer to shore, along Lake Champlain in the Northern part of town. <a href="https://billmorris.io/shoals/posts/2023-07-12_beautiful-summer/">The recent flooding elsewhere in Vermont</a> had now reached the lake, and he was worried that the rising waters would carry off his summer recreation plans. So I pitched in.</p>

<p>Wading in at the debris-filled shore, I spotted a bright, straight-edged object in the water, and hauled it out. It was a cocktail menu!</p>

<p><img src="/shoals/assets/img/2023-07-25_4.jpeg" alt="4" /></p>

<p>More specifically, it was a cocktail menu from <a href="https://www.theolddockhouseonchamplain.com/">The Old Dock</a>, a bar I knew from long bike rides around the lake, and from ill-advised treks up I-87 as a way of getting back to Burlington from NYC. I had actually been past there in April, though they weren’t open for the season yet, and the place had the weather-beaten look of a long winter endured.</p>

<p><img src="/shoals/assets/img/2023-07-25_2.jpeg" alt="2" /></p>

<p>The Old Dock is in Essex, on the New York side of the Southernmost ferry connection with Vermont. Essex is . . . kind of a long way from Burlington as the menu drifts. <a href="https://felt.com/map/Old-Dock-Menu-YJvXQH1NQEmRmBOz5vVltD?loc=44.3884,-73.2569,10.64z&amp;share=1">14 miles of open water</a>, actually.</p>

<p><img src="/shoals/assets/img/2023-07-25_1.png" alt="1" /></p>

<p>While I was immediately compelled by the epic journey of this lonely menu, I’ve also considered the possibility that it was brought over by accident in the hands of a forgetful boater after one too many of the “Dock Fizz”.</p>

<p>Or maybe it was a bored gull.</p>

<p><img src="/shoals/assets/img/2023-07-25_3.jpeg" alt="3" /></p>

<p>Regardless, I’ll plan to bring it back on my next trip over there, with the tale of how far it drifted in the current.</p>
