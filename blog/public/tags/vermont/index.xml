      <description>Summer is great.
I keep forgetting this, but the shores of Lake Champlain - for a blessed few months every year - are an absolute paradise.

The Burlington, VT metro grew at about the same rate as NYC: just under 7%, which is respectable but looks sclerotic compared to Atlanta or Houston.</description>
