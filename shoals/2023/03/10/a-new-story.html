<p>It’s late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner.</p>

<p>This year it’s harder than ever.</p>

<p>My right knee has been bothering me since last summer, after some particularly long and brutal trail runs, after 100 miles of backpacking, after . . . maybe something I don’t even recall. It started quiet and progressed to a yell walking up and down stairs by Thanksgiving. The results of my MRI are now in, and it’s tempting to hear them with dramatic music playing in the background:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advanced Chondrosis, with cartilage fissuring and bone edema</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best translation I’ve got is that <strong>I’ve ruined my knee in a way that won’t heal.</strong></p>

<p>The one clear message I’m getting from everyone - physicians, runners, bloggers, running doctor bloggers - is that I should all but stop running. This isn’t garden-variety arthritis; this is <em>damage</em>, and I should find a new sport with lower impact, to extend the life of my knee before a now-inevitable replacement. So, like several billion of my middle-aged brethren before me, I’ll have to adjust - try to make a go of it with cycling or rowing or quietly reading. But that hurts, because running, to me, is perfect. All you need is a pair of shoes, and you can do it anywhere in the world, in any conditions. I’m going to miss it like I’d miss home.</p>

<p>I’m in the dangerous position of being able to construct multiple narratives about my life as a runner. If I squint and tilt my head one way, I see a late-blooming enthusiasm of very recent years, that led me to start piling up miles and <em>seriousness</em> even before a pandemic made running the perfect obsessive coping strategy. If I tilt the other way, I read a story of a little fat kid who showed up to track practice one day; whose coach - Tim Simpson, bless you - didn’t laugh him off the field but instead got him moving; of someone who’s been running ever since. Both narratives are “correct”, but both are coming to an end.</p>

<p>Time to get to work on a new story.</p>
