        <p>It&rsquo;s late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner.</p>
<p>This year it&rsquo;s harder than ever.</p>
<p>My right knee has been bothering me since last summer, after some particularly long and brutal trail runs, after 100 miles of backpacking, after . . . maybe something I don&rsquo;t even recall. It started quiet and progressed to a yell walking up and down stairs by Thanksgiving. The results of my MRI are now in, and it&rsquo;s tempting to hear them with dramatic music playing in the background:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Chondrosis, with cartilage fissuring and bone edema</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best translation I&rsquo;ve got is that <strong>I&rsquo;ve ruined my knee in a way that won&rsquo;t heal.</strong></p>
<p>The one clear message I&rsquo;m getting from everyone - physicians, runners, bloggers, running doctor bloggers - is that I should all but stop running. This isn&rsquo;t garden-variety arthritis; this is <em>damage</em>, and I should find a new sport with lower impact, to extend the life of my knee before a now-inevitable replacement. So, like several billion of my middle-aged brethren before me, I&rsquo;ll have to adjust - try to make a go of it with cycling or rowing or quietly reading. But that hurts, because running, to me, is perfect. All you need is a pair of shoes, and you can do it anywhere in the world, in any conditions. I&rsquo;m going to miss it like I&rsquo;d miss home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the dangerous position of being able to construct multiple narratives about my life as a runner. If I squint and tilt my head one way, I see a late-blooming enthusiasm of very recent years, that led me to start piling up miles and <em>seriousness</em> even before a pandemic made running the perfect obsessive coping strategy. If I tilt the other way, I read a story of a little fat kid who showed up to track practice one day; whose coach - Tim Simpson, bless you - didn&rsquo;t laugh him off the field but instead got him moving; of someone who&rsquo;s been running ever since. Both narratives are &ldquo;correct&rdquo;, but both are coming to an end.</p>
<p>Time to get to work on a new story.</p>
