      <description>We at Faraday are data science experts. We have a collective century of experience in the mystical arts of data whispering; we&amp;rsquo;ve transformed oceans of rows and columns, built and discarded thousands of databases, and molded far-seeing algorithms in a dozen programming languages.
But we mostly use SQL.
SQL is the old-as-the-hills workhorse that is interoperable with nearly everything, vaguely-consistent across ecosystems, and hella-flexible. We use it to count people over the age of 65, and we also use it to find local spatial autocorrelation across live-aggregated geographies.</description>

      <description>The order is placed On CyberMonday I ordered one of those custom-printed phone case thingies because Google ran a hard sell. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait!
Hmmm . . . looks like it shipped. Lemme check the status.
Holy hell, it&amp;rsquo;s a map! It shows where my phone case is!
Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s currently in . . . Shenzhen! Sweet! This is already a clearer window into the supply chain than what I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to .</description>
