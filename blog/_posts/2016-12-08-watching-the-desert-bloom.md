[Landsat 1]() launched in 1973, and the world hasn't been the same since. Nearly 50 years later, Google has provided a way of realizing the promise of such a long transect of data, offering [a viewing portal for timelapses anywhere on earth](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) (well, anywhere that the clouds occasionally part).

I refer to this tool regularly, but most recently I found examples of amazing human activity, here, in **the middle of the Algerian Sahara**

Someone [tries pivot-irrigated wheat](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=27.20537,2.36567,12.202,latLng&t=2.56) for a few years in the late 90s:

The wheat gets literally swallowed by the dunes, when . . . what? When the money runs out? When the fossil water goes dry?

The next move is orchards, looks like dates or citrus trees up close:

And those are still there. In the middle of the Sahara. Maybe those dates are in your local Whole Foods. The place is called Ain Salah - an oasis town on an ancient caravan route. One example of an explosion of agriculture in the Sahara.

At [Al Jawf, in Libya](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=24.14438,23.23597,11.172,latLng&t=2.33) - they tried out a land distribution tactic also visible in the Bolivian Amazon:

Ghadduwah, Libya - [this actually LOOKS like someone dropped a seed-bomb](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=26.58609,14.32547,10.939,latLng&t=2.50) around 2006:

As a counterpoint, [here's some mesmerizing natural dune motion](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=27.20591,4.89959,9.838,latLng&t=1.57) over the same time period:

Zaiouet Kounta, Algeria: [someone does an actual rotation cycle](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=27.30289,-0.08787,11.361,latLng&t=2.56), moving the fields around year to year:

I don't mean to sound too judgmental here - these are incredible feats of engineering. Humans are making the desert bloom. But seeing the speed of transformation is astonishing and unnerving. It's shock and awe on the fringes of a globalized food system. And it's amazing that we can see it happen on fast-forward, thanks to Google and the Landsat program.
