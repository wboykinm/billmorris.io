      <description>Follow along using this map made with Felt
One day this past July, I got up early and started a long run around Paris. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this practice to be the easiest way to explore without being an insufferable tourist. As I usually do, I started tracking the run with my Garmin Forerunner 245 watch.
My watch, unbeknownst to me, decided that I was actually starting 3km South, near the Institut Curie.</description>

Greenhead I told everyone who asked that I slept well. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really true; the room was well-heated and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing but a comforter, reinforcing the fact that I sleep best in the cold. On the flip side, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to complain because thanks to the over-powered heaters, every scrap of clothing and shoe I have is completely dry.
No rain is forecast for today, my third walking Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall Path.</description>
