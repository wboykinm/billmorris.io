            A throwback mapping technique at the modern console
My arcane problem I’ve recently been spending a lot of time on Faraday’s remote servers, running one PostGIS operation after another in search of idealized geometries or custom market borders. In each case, I like to do a visual check to see that I haven’t created a node-sharing, topologically-laughable geo-monster before handing it off to another process on the same server.

            It’s about the political ecology of global agricultural systems, but Ello enables it.
Update: Since February I have indeed stopped this series of imagery posts to Ello. However, this has much to do with my lack of available time to locate, assess and process the images. It was a fun and finite project.
I’ve been posting a bunch of stuff on Ello recently. Mostly it’s big images of farmland, taken from space.

Gotta love the classics
My city is on the tail end of the country’s redistricting cycle. Somehow while Texas was marginalizing Latinos and Dennis Kucinich was getting scribbled out of his constituency, we here in Burlington were waffling over how to deal with triparty politics and the implications of our changing neighborhoods.
I was unrealistic early on about how much of a role technology could play in the process.

            A history in cartographic tools
The last-known record of the author using hand tools for mapping, AD 2003
1998 The GIS lab at Middlebury College had a set of drafting pens hanging on the wall, dust on top of the box. There was also a ruler and a caliper-like thing in there, a curiosity as we labored over the new arcane of ArcView and Illustrator. Rumor had it that Professor Churchill had once used those pens in the dim ages.

            Working with shaded relief and satellite imagery in Mapbox Studio
I have a minor quibble. Amid the wonders that the Mapbox team has been producing of late, they’ve rebranded the groundbreaking Tilemill as Mapbox Studio, given it a souped-up engine powered by OpenStreetmap-based vector tiles, and turned it loose on the beta crowd to a reception somewhere between “rapturous” and “bieberesque”. It makes web mapping both better-supported and more flexible, and at Faraday we quickly used it to build our basemap.

            How Google should be thinking about their rumored satellites if they aren’t already (but I bet they are)
About 10PM last night, I saw some interesting news dropped:
WSJ: @google to spend $1billion+ on ~180 @satellites_ to provide Internet access around globe http://t.co/k4LJu5CRR0 pic.twitter.com/BoaCUBzzGv
&mdash; Alex Howard (@digiphile) June 2, 2014 Completely light on details (“A billion dollars!” “180 new satellites!” “Internet everywhere!”), the story is that Google will be pouring cash into previously-insurmountable technical challenges, and bringing satellite-borne internet to the world.
