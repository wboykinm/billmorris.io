<p>I’ve been posting a bunch of stuff <a href="https://ello.co/vtcraghead">on Ello</a> recently. Mostly it’s big images of farmland, taken from space. The reason I process them and post them is that the view from above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_ecology#Overview">can teach us a lot</a> about the dynamics of money and power on the ground. We make a huge impact on the land and on each other as a result.</p>

<p>Hayer, Alberta</p>

<p>Ello is a nice place to put these images because they get a large container. That’s it. That’s the main reason I like it. Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr all shrink visual content to ~<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of screen width, but obsessively-flat-and-borderless Ello gives it a big window, bigger with a collapsed sidebar.</p>

<p>The spare view</p>

<p>And that lets me focus on things like the shape of cultivated fields or the spread-out pattern of an invasive tree species. Because that stuff — with implications for livelihoods, hunger and ecology — is what matters. It’s nice that Ello is local (for me), and that it’s ad-free and that it’s registered as a public-benefit corporation, but that’s secondary to the layout.</p>

<p>I’ll be keeping up the vertical-perspective storytelling over there in something like digest form, so <a href="https://ello.co/vtcraghead">check it out</a>.</p>
