            It&rsquo;s late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner.
This year it&rsquo;s harder than ever.
My right knee has been bothering me since last summer, after some particularly long and brutal trail runs, after 100 miles of backpacking, after .

            Y&rsquo;all.
I&rsquo;ve wandered over to Mastodon from Twitter, along with a goodly number of other folks from the broad geo-sphere, and it&rsquo;s . . . nice. Feel easier to post random musings. Less motive, less image. But I rolled back over to Twitter right quick when I wanted to get into the discussion over a Sunday NYT article about my tiny-ass Vermont city. I have certain communities in my feed, and the #btv folks are still mostly there.

            Instructions for getting a [mostly] static website onto a custom domain, with https encryption, for [mostly] free. I&rsquo;m finally writing this down after getting stuck on step 10 way too many times. Godspeed.
Purchase the top-level domain - gandi.net is my current preferred registrar. Hopefully this will be the only cash you drop in this process. Create a new public repository on github. Clone the new repo locally and create your site content package, even starting with something as simple as a standalone index.

On November 9, 1938, Goebbels turned the SA loose on Jewish communities throughout Germany, in a pogrom now known as Kristallnacht. With the veneer of a &ldquo;popular, spontaneous uprising&rdquo;, nazis smashed Jewish business, attacked Jews, and arrested them in the thousands, heralding the horrors to come.
1400 Synagogues were burned or broken.

            That’s right folks, it happened - an OpenStreetMap vandal made it to prime time:
Anti-Semitic Vandalism Lists New York as 'Jewtropolis' on Snapchat, CitiBike, and More
About three weeks ago, some roblox-loving, likely-gamergater mini-nazi decided to re-label New York City in OSM (along with a bunch of other landmarks). It was almost immediately caught and reverted by community members, but it somehow slipped through the Mapbox review process and made it into production today long enough for some users to notice it (though it’s since been fixed).

            Many an earnest cartographer/journalist/opinion-holder is currently debating — with varying degrees of condescension — the utility of the @nytimes’ latest map piece:
Some people argued that we should have used opacity or a dot map to adjust for population density in our 2016 precinct maps. fwiw, here&#39;s why we didn&#39;t... https://t.co/RSqOlJx7SB
&mdash; Josh Katz (@jshkatz) July 27, 2018 While some arguments are specious (specifically, I’m not sure what species of monster you have to be to fail to enjoy a good birds-eye perspective), and others are just petty, the most valid argument wrangles with the nature of our Republic, and how best to convey that Acres don’t vote.
