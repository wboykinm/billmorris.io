    <blockquote>
  <p>A history in cartographic tools</p>
</blockquote>

The last-known record of the author using hand tools for mapping, AD 2003</p>

<h4 id="1998">1998</h4>

<p>The GIS lab at Middlebury College had a set of drafting pens hanging on the wall, dust on top of the box. There was also a ruler and a caliper-like thing in there, a curiosity as we labored over the new arcane of ArcView and Illustrator. Rumor had it that Professor Churchill had once used those pens in the dim ages.</p>

<h4 id="2003">2003</h4>

<p>Openstreetmap would have been a godsend to my 23-year-old self, sweating ceaselessly over light cardstock and sheafs of tracing paper as I planned a gravity-fed aqueduct for a village in the Dominican rainforest. A survey-grade GPS would have saved weeks, replacing the hackjob of an elevation profile I cobbled together with an abney level, a twenty-foot pole, a tape measure and a Peace Corps colleague.</p>

<h4 id="2005">2005</h4>

<p>Every few weeks I would go to Nagua — the nearest city — and sit in front of a fan in the office of a local NGO, glued to a computer equipped with manna from heaven: an ArcView 3.2 license donated by the German Development Service. I made bad maps of the nearby protected area, and worse maps of the surrounding villages.</p>

<h4 id="2006">2006</h4>

<p>I had two monitors in my cubicle at Boston University — one fancy newfangled flatscreen and the other an old vacuum tube box, perched on top of a Unix station that I would occasionally boot up to run scripts that I didn’t understand, given to me by indulgent colleagues. I made maps of crops from one-kilometer pixels, using a curiosity called “Google Earth” to find training sites that big all over the world.</p>

<h4 id="2008">2008</h4>

<p>The plotter at the engineering firm where I worked initially lived near my desk. I learned all the right PDF export settings so that it would — over half an hour or so — spit out a crisp, annotated orthophoto on an ArchD sheet that a project manager would take to an awkward public forum on a new highway onramp or ski resort parking lot. I used my mouse as a weapon in those days, digitizing as though my life depended on it.</p>

<h4 id="2010">2010</h4>

<p>An army of University of Vermont undergrads carried a hundred letter-sized sheets of paper — detailing sites for daily bird counts — with them weekly into the cold dawn hours of a fast Fall. I used bookmarks in ArcMap to stay organized; I curated them meticulously, then mourned when they disappeared in a fried external hard drive. I moved on.</p>

<h4 id="2012">2012</h4>

<p>It was always pleasant to walk the wide streets of Rabat on the way to the USAID contractor’s office. In my messenger bag was a netbook with QGIS on it, and it provided most of the juice needed to map an agricultural census and put it on the web. A colleague who spoke Arabic, French, Berber and PHP had to email another consultant that I couldn’t open the geodatabases he provided; could he send shapefiles?</p>

<h4 id="2014">2014</h4>

<p>A dozen Vermonters sit at their macbooks, tracing out roads and houses in Kailahun — a place they’ve never been, and most likely will never visit. I try to help with feature questions and tech support, though my voice is raw from a cold and everyone has a pretty good handle on the process anyway. They use their trackpads like weapons, digitizing because others’ lives depend on it.</p>

<h4 id="now">Now</h4>

<p>A query — formulated in a text editor and pasted into the psql command line — calculates a density index in a database of households likely to invest in solar panels. As I wait I look out over the lake at a snow squall rolling across from the Adirondacks, already whitecapped. The query finishes and I move on to the next one.</p>
