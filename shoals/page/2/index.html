            Bernie Sanders’ hometown of Burlington, VT is tiny: just 200k people in the metro area. Barcelona, on the other hand, clocks in at 4.7 million. These are wildly-different scales (different everything, really), but when one of my legislators brought up Barcelona’s planned superblocks, I couldn’t help but imagine the radical livability experiment playing out in Burlington.
Here's an idea to incorporate into #btv mall redevelopment. @councilortracy @JaneKnodell <a href="https://t.co/c2ol8eLBZA">https://t.co/c2ol8eLBZA</a>
— Christopher Pearson (@Pearson_VT) August 8, 2016 Superblocks, in a nutshell, are a rearrangement of transportation in a gridded urban area.

            Lake Baringo, Kenya — Image by Digital Globe, 2014
On a plain in western Kenya, mesquite trees flourish where a river spills out of the mountains. Introduced from North America, mesquite has been used worldwide for rapid re-afforestation. It sinks deep roots, quickly. It fixes nitrogen and sequesters carbon.
It’s visible from space.
In the global fight against deforestation, Earth-observing satellites have spent decades whirling around the planet, confirming successful conservation projects and sounding seemingly-endless new alarms on wildcat miners and on seasonal slash and burn.

            Howdy folks.
Sanderista here.
I have some thoughts.
@HillaryClinton is a remarkable American.
She has experience at all levels of government establishing broadly-liberal policies, and had to fight for every inch.
I like that. I will vote for her in the general if she wins the primary.
I prefer @BernieSanders, because — as I’ve had the privilege of being represented by him since I was a kid — I’ve seen his prescience, his relentlessness and his progress.

            I have trouble getting together with friends these days. I’m not alone in this — distance is a surprising obstacle to maintaining relationships in the landscape of modern America. Can a hack-of-an-app help?
Over Thanksgiving I was traveling with my family and found out that a friend — one I don’t often see — would be nearby. As often happens in these situations, I mentally considered “what semi-decent bar is about halfway between us?

            In which I find a parallel universe in my own backyard
Upon the occasion of Halloween, and the need to optimize, I took a look at NextDoor for the first time. They apparently had some sort of dope candy-targeting map for every neighborhood, and since that’s my catnip I had to check it out. Step 1: sign up, because the candymap is actually just a big inbound marketing trap:

            The new Mapbox Studio just went to private beta today. Here’s what I’ve learned using it.
I just hope I can start playing with the new @mapbox editor ASAP. it looks nice guys! Maps everywhere!
— saleiva (@saleiva) September 17, 2015 There’s a lot of marketing behind the new Mapbox Studio, along with a glowing review in Wired. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to play with it for a few months now as it developed, and the Mapbox team should be proud.
