Greenhead I told everyone who asked that I slept well. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really true; the room was well-heated and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing but a comforter, reinforcing the fact that I sleep best in the cold. On the flip side, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to complain because thanks to the over-powered heaters, every scrap of clothing and shoe I have is completely dry.
No rain is forecast for today, my third walking Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall Path.</description>
