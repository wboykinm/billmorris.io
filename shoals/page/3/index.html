            In which I find a parallel universe in my own backyard
Upon the occasion of Halloween, and the need to optimize, I took a look at NextDoor for the first time. They apparently had some sort of dope candy-targeting map for every neighborhood, and since that’s my catnip I had to check it out. Step 1: sign up, because the candymap is actually just a big inbound marketing trap:

            The new Mapbox Studio just went to private beta today. Here’s what I’ve learned using it.
I just hope I can start playing with the new @mapbox editor ASAP. it looks nice guys! Maps everywhere!
— saleiva (@saleiva) September 17, 2015  There’s a lot of marketing behind the new Mapbox Studio, along with a glowing review in Wired. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to play with it for a few months now as it developed, and the Mapbox team should be proud.

            The work of a vandal reminds us what’s missing from the map.
The incident This morning Ahmad Babar noticed a curious feature on Google Maps just South of Rawalpindi, Pakistan:
Dammit, Calvin.
Yes indeed — an android pissing on an Apple logo, rendered in the color that Google typically uses to signify a park or natural area. It was a part of the basemap! The internet howled with glee:

            A throwback mapping technique at the modern console
My arcane problem I’ve recently been spending a lot of time on Faraday’s remote servers, running one PostGIS operation after another in search of idealized geometries or custom market borders. In each case, I like to do a visual check to see that I haven’t created a node-sharing, topologically-laughable geo-monster before handing it off to another process on the same server.

            It’s about the political ecology of global agricultural systems, but Ello enables it.
Update: Since February I have indeed stopped this series of imagery posts to Ello. However, this has much to do with my lack of available time to locate, assess and process the images. It was a fun and finite project.
I’ve been posting a bunch of stuff on Ello recently. Mostly it’s big images of farmland, taken from space.
