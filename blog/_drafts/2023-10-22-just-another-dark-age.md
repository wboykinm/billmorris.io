## Cluj-Napoca

In the late Autumn of 1936, a youthful Patrick Leigh-Fermor entered the Transylvanian city of Cluj-Napoca, accompanied by a blushing, illicit lover and by an enthusiastic wingman. Distracted as he was by such great company, he still took note of the simple grandeur around him:

>

He left before long on [his fabled foot journey to Constantinople](), never to return. The cataclysm that was about to envelop Europe would also draw a veil on Romania for decades to come.

In the Spring of 1991, Dervla Murphy - forced by injury to take the train instead of [her own customary walking or cycling]() - alighted into Cluj-Napoca. She had headed for Romania within weeks of CeauÈ™escu's deposition, in the tumult of the USSR's dissolution, looking for stories from the ground. An ardent listener and observer, she noted:

Leigh-Fermor and Murphy are my bookends for Cluj-Napoca. I have no sense of what happened in those intervening years; only macrohistory, geopolitics, and rumor. For me - one reader in my own obscure corner of the world - a dark age occupies the space between, and imagination runs wild.

## Sala Colonia

I once stood among Roman ruins along Morocco's Atlantic coast, and foolishly imagined that I could fill in gaps of chronology with emotions and stories. At the time, [I wrote](https://billmorris.io/shoals/2012/10/06/after-empire.html):

> And they were still there when - in 546 A.D. - the news reached them that Rome had been burned to the ground and its people scattered. That the Ostrogoths had ended the empire. Legions had been recalled from Britain, Iberia, Gaul and Syria - pulled back to defend the city - but the inhabitants of Sala Colonia had been overlooked. And they learned after it was done, that they were alone.

I wish I could say these were the thoughts of an emo teenager, but alas, this was only ten years ago, when I was in Rabat working for USAID. Beyond my sad grasp of late Roman history (I referenced the wrong sack of Rome! Alaric weeps in his grave.), it was selfish of me to try to buckle a post-apocalyptic tone onto stories two thousand years gone. I should have known better.

Exactly what "I should have known better" is a bit tough to pin down, but it relates to the concept of the Dark Ages.

## Rome never fell

## USSR & SPQR
