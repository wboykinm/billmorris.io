      <description>That’s right folks, it happened - an OpenStreetMap vandal made it to prime time:
Anti-Semitic Vandalism Lists New York as &amp;#39;Jewtropolis&amp;#39; on Snapchat, CitiBike, and More
About three weeks ago, some roblox-loving, likely-gamergater mini-nazi decided to re-label New York City in OSM (along with a bunch of other landmarks). It was almost immediately caught and reverted by community members, but it somehow slipped through the Mapbox review process and made it into production today long enough for some users to notice it (though it’s since been fixed).</description>

      <description>Many an earnest cartographer/journalist/opinion-holder is currently debating — with varying degrees of condescension — the utility of the @nytimes’ latest map piece:
Some people argued that we should have used opacity or a dot map to adjust for population density in our 2016 precinct maps. fwiw, here&amp;#39;s why we didn&amp;#39;t... https://t.co/RSqOlJx7SB
&amp;mdash; Josh Katz (@jshkatz) July 27, 2018  While some arguments are specious (specifically, I’m not sure what species of monster you have to be to fail to enjoy a good birds-eye perspective), and others are just petty, the most valid argument wrangles with the nature of our Republic, and how best to convey that Acres don’t vote.</description>

      <description>“Yup, take the Pendoil bridge just past Sad Cahue Village, and you’ll be up ta’ Ponkey before ya know it!”
 Y’all, we’ve entered a computing epoch when AI is available to us at nearly the level of commodity entertainment. Take this experiment in generative British placenames by Dan Hon; his workflow is 7 goddamn steps to use technology only the likes of Alan Turing could have dreamed up, until a few years ago.</description>

      <description>To take my mind off certain things, I’ve been experimenting with a novel style of cartography: cubism.
I arrived here on a wave of hype via an app called Prisma — a nifty take on the “filter-and-share” photo paradigm; it applies a touch of machine learning to redraw your image in an array of artistic styles. You’ve definitely seen the results in the wild, sometimes stunning, sometimes godawful, usually determined by the quality of the source image.</description>

      <description>HRC campaign events and volunteer opportunities around Oakland, CA
Everything happens somewhere. In the home stretch of this epic presidential campaign season, location awareness can impact the razor-thin vote margins we expect to see in battleground states.
Hillary Clinton’s campaign has an excellent, centralized database of rallies, phone banks and canvassing efforts, all of which need volunteers. In order to lower the bar to participation as much as possible, the digital volunteers of DevProgress constructed an application on top of the campaign events database -it shows events near you.</description>

      <description>Bernie Sanders’ hometown of Burlington, VT is tiny: just 200k people in the metro area. Barcelona, on the other hand, clocks in at 4.7 million. These are wildly-different scales (different everything, really), but when one of my legislators brought up Barcelona’s planned superblocks, I couldn’t help but imagine the radical livability experiment playing out in Burlington.
Here&amp;#39;s an idea to incorporate into #btv mall redevelopment. @councilortracy @JaneKnodell https://t.co/c2ol8eLBZA
&amp;mdash; Christopher Pearson (@SenatorCP) August 8, 2016  Superblocks, in a nutshell, are a rearrangement of transportation in a gridded urban area.</description>

      <description>Lake Baringo, Kenya — Image by Digital Globe, 2014
On a plain in western Kenya, mesquite trees flourish where a river spills out of the mountains. Introduced from North America, mesquite has been used worldwide for rapid re-afforestation. It sinks deep roots, quickly. It fixes nitrogen and sequesters carbon.
 It’s visible from space.
 In the global fight against deforestation, Earth-observing satellites have spent decades whirling around the planet, confirming successful conservation projects and sounding seemingly-endless new alarms on wildcat miners and on seasonal slash and burn.</description>

      <description>Howdy folks.
Sanderista here.
I have some thoughts.
@HillaryClinton is a remarkable American.
She has experience at all levels of government establishing broadly-liberal policies, and had to fight for every inch.
I like that. I will vote for her in the general if she wins the primary.
I prefer @BernieSanders, because — as I’ve had the privilege of being represented by him since I was a kid — I’ve seen his prescience, his relentlessness and his progress.</description>

      <description>I have trouble getting together with friends these days. I’m not alone in this — distance is a surprising obstacle to maintaining relationships in the landscape of modern America. Can a hack-of-an-app help?
 Over Thanksgiving I was traveling with my family and found out that a friend — one I don’t often see — would be nearby. As often happens in these situations, I mentally considered “what semi-decent bar is about halfway between us?</description>

      <description>In which I find a parallel universe in my own backyard
 Upon the occasion of Halloween, and the need to optimize, I took a look at NextDoor for the first time. They apparently had some sort of dope candy-targeting map for every neighborhood, and since that’s my catnip I had to check it out. Step 1: sign up, because the candymap is actually just a big inbound marketing trap:</description>

      <description>The new Mapbox Studio just went to private beta today. Here’s what I’ve learned using it.
 I just hope I can start playing with the new @mapbox editor ASAP. it looks nice guys! Maps everywhere!
&amp;mdash; saleiva (@saleiva) September 17, 2015  There’s a lot of marketing behind the new Mapbox Studio, along with a glowing review in Wired. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to play with it for a few months now as it developed, and the Mapbox team should be proud.</description>

      <description>The work of a vandal reminds us what’s missing from the map.
 The incident This morning Ahmad Babar noticed a curious feature on Google Maps just South of Rawalpindi, Pakistan:
Dammit, Calvin.
Yes indeed — an android pissing on an Apple logo, rendered in the color that Google typically uses to signify a park or natural area. It was a part of the basemap! The internet howled with glee:</description>

      <description>A throwback mapping technique at the modern console
 My arcane problem I’ve recently been spending a lot of time on Faraday’s remote servers, running one PostGIS operation after another in search of idealized geometries or custom market borders. In each case, I like to do a visual check to see that I haven’t created a node-sharing, topologically-laughable geo-monster before handing it off to another process on the same server.</description>

      <description>It’s about the political ecology of global agricultural systems, but Ello enables it.
 Update: Since February I have indeed stopped this series of imagery posts to Ello. However, this has much to do with my lack of available time to locate, assess and process the images. It was a fun and finite project.
I’ve been posting a bunch of stuff on Ello recently. Mostly it’s big images of farmland, taken from space.</description>

      <description>Alert: Both policy AND technology will be discussed below. Bring both your brains. You’ve been warned.
Gotta love the classics
My city is on the tail end of the country’s redistricting cycle. Somehow while Texas was marginalizing Latinos and Dennis Kucinich was getting scribbled out of his constituency, we here in Burlington were waffling over how to deal with triparty politics and the implications of our changing neighborhoods.
I was unrealistic early on about how much of a role technology could play in the process.</description>

      <description>A history in cartographic tools
 The last-known record of the author using hand tools for mapping, AD 2003
1998 The GIS lab at Middlebury College had a set of drafting pens hanging on the wall, dust on top of the box. There was also a ruler and a caliper-like thing in there, a curiosity as we labored over the new arcane of ArcView and Illustrator. Rumor had it that Professor Churchill had once used those pens in the dim ages.</description>

      <description>Working with shaded relief and satellite imagery in Mapbox Studio
 I have a minor quibble. Amid the wonders that the Mapbox team has been producing of late, they’ve rebranded the groundbreaking Tilemill as Mapbox Studio, given it a souped-up engine powered by OpenStreetmap-based vector tiles, and turned it loose on the beta crowd to a reception somewhere between “rapturous” and “bieberesque”. It makes web mapping both better-supported and more flexible, and at Faraday we quickly used it to build our basemap.</description>

      <description>How Google should be thinking about their rumored satellites if they aren’t already (but I bet they are)
 About 10PM last night, I saw some interesting news dropped:
WSJ: @google to spend $1billion+ on ~180 @satellites_ to provide Internet access around globe http://t.co/k4LJu5CRR0 pic.twitter.com/BoaCUBzzGv
&amp;mdash; Alex Howard (@digiphile) June 2, 2014  Completely light on details (“A billion dollars!” “180 new satellites!” “Internet everywhere!”), the story is that Google will be pouring cash into previously-insurmountable technical challenges, and bringing satellite-borne internet to the world.</description>
