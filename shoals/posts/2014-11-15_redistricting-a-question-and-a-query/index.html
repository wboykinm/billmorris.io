<p>Gotta love the classics</p>

<p>My city is on the tail end of the country’s redistricting cycle. Somehow while Texas was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/texas-redistricting-discriminated-latino-voters_n_1838030.html">marginalizing Latinos</a> and Dennis Kucinich was <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/03/07/kucinich-squeezed-out-by-redistricting-loses-primary-to-kaptur-in-ohio/">getting scribbled out of his constituency</a>, we here in Burlington were <a href="http://7d.blogs.com/offmessage/2013/12/burlington-city-council-mulls-redistricting-take-457.html">waffling</a> over how to deal with triparty politics and the implications of our changing neighborhoods.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/2014-11-15_redistricting-a-question-and-a-query/images/2.jpeg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I was unrealistic early on about how much of a role technology could play in the process. A <a href="http://btvhoods.geosprocket.org/results2.html">survey of neighborhood geographic identity</a> and a do-it-yourself redistricting app (sidebar) were helpful but not game-changing. After years of wrangling, the parties mostly just hashed it out in committee (though the final plan is derived from one made with our <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/Home">DistrictBuilder</a> app), and now in about 6 weeks the voters will approve or reject it.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question: What would the proposed plan change things for the average BTV citizen? It’s a pretty easy one to answer in the aggregate — all the information is out there: new boundaries, old boundaries, population distribution, polling locations. But these bits are spread out across various sites and articles.</p>

<p>What if there was a way to just ask the question: <strong>How will this change things for me?</strong></p>

<p>Under the umbrella of <a href="http://codeforbtv.org/">CodeForBTV</a> — the local CodeforAmerica brigade — I put together <a href="http://codeforbtv.org/votefinder/">the basic answering tool</a>. Built for phones (via Bootstrap), the app lets the user plug in their address and get back a list of redistricting plan implications:</p>

<p><img src="/posts/2014-11-15_redistricting-a-question-and-a-query/images/3.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The question of individual impact can be answered with a simple spatial query: return some pieces of information based on the polygons that intersect the user’s location. This pointed to some basic building blocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/wboykinm/7ef57cd1e58fc626ee3c#file-map-geojson">city redistricting plan</a> — both the old wards and the new ones lumped into one geojson file</li>
<li>A robust search engine — I went with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a> because of the amazing viewport-biased geocoding and the built-in typeahead, but given more time I would use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and a <a href="http://vcgi.vermont.gov/warehouse/web_services/geocoding">state-hosted geocoder</a> plus <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/">typeahead.js</a></li>
<li>Spatial query capability — fortunately <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/cartodb-js.html">CartoDB</a> offers all the magic of PostGIS at a URL endpoint, with great styling available as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user-selected address gets converted to lat/lon, then <a href="https://github.com/codeforbtv/votefinder/blob/master/votefind.js#L57">sent to the CartoDB API in an ST_Intersects() query</a>. It returns a map overlay of the old and new district boundaries at the site, and a set of answers to some FAQs about redistricting. It’s a simple app, relying on some robust APIs. I hope it’s useful in getting my neighbors oriented to the landscape of the proposed redistricting. At the very least it’ll save people some time peering at a large paper map in city hall, and at best it’ll head off 40,000 individual “how will this affect me” emails directed at the city councilors and GIS manager. I also hope it’ll be of use to anyone else who wants to present geographic change over time at a user-selected location.</p>
