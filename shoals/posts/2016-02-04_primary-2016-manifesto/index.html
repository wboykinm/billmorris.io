Sanderista here.
I have some thoughts.
@HillaryClinton is a remarkable American.
She has experience at all levels of government establishing broadly-liberal policies, and had to fight for every inch.
I like that. I will vote for her in the general if she wins the primary.
I prefer @BernieSanders, because — as I’ve had the privilege of being represented by him since I was a kid — I’ve seen his prescience, his relentlessness and his progress."/>

<p>Howdy folks.</p>

<p>Sanderista here.</p>

<p>I have some thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton">@HillaryClinton</a> is a remarkable American.</p>

<p>She has experience at all levels of government establishing broadly-liberal policies, and had to fight for every inch.</p>

<p>I like that. I will vote for her in the general if she wins the primary.</p>

<p>I prefer <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders">@BernieSanders</a>, because — as I’ve had the privilege of being represented by him since I was a kid — I’ve seen his prescience, his relentlessness and his progress. He has fought for me. Every citizen of this country deserves his advocacy, and a piece of my good fortune in having experienced it.</p>

<p>But again, I’m not a f***ing idiot. <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton">@HillaryClinton</a> isn’t just someone I’ll “hold my nose and vote for”.</p>

<p>I’d be proud to have her as my president. I hope-bordering-on-demand that her supporters feel the same way about <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders">@BernieSanders</a>.</p>

<p>I like Hillary. I’m voting Bernie.</p>

<p>I’m not alone.</p>

<p>In fact, I better f***ing well be legion; the future of the Republic requires it.</p>
