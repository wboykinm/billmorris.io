      <description>We at Faraday are data science experts. We have a collective century of experience in the mystical arts of data whispering; we&amp;rsquo;ve transformed oceans of rows and columns, built and discarded thousands of databases, and molded far-seeing algorithms in a dozen programming languages.
But we mostly use SQL.
SQL is the old-as-the-hills workhorse that is interoperable with nearly everything, vaguely-consistent across ecosystems, and hella-flexible. We use it to count people over the age of 65, and we also use it to find local spatial autocorrelation across live-aggregated geographies.</description>
