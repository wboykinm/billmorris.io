I once stood among Roman ruins along Morocco's Atlantic coast, and foolishly imagined that I could fill in gaps of chronology with emotions and stories. At the time, [I wrote](https://billmorris.io/shoals/2012/10/06/after-empire.html):

> And they were still there when - in 546 A.D. - the news reached them that Rome had been burned to the ground and its people scattered. That the Ostrogoths had ended the empire. Legions had been recalled from Britain, Iberia, Gaul and Syria - pulled back to defend the city - but the inhabitants of Sala Colonia had been overlooked. And they learned after it was done, that they were alone.

I wish I could say these were the thoughts of an emo teenager, but alas, this was only ten years ago, when I was in Rabat working for USAID. Beyond my sad grasp of late Roman history (I referenced the wrong sack of Rome! Alaric weeps in his grave.), it was selfish of me to try to buckle a post-apocalyptic tone onto stories two thousand years gone. I should have known better.

Exactly what "I should have known better" is a bit tough to pin down, but it relates to the concept of the Dark Ages.
