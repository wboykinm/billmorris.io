The time had finally come to sort through and [mostly] discard the stuff I'd accumulated in the last days when higher education was conducted on paper. What follows is merely a selection.

## Snowbowl trail map, 10/10

![1](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_1.jpg)

A seminal masterpiece of student ski cartography by the inimitable Dana Allen, lately of [Backcountry Magazine](https://backcountrymagazine.com/gear/testers-choice-dana-allens-picks/).

## The last map series I ever made with an Esri product, 6/10

![2](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_2.jpg)

For an avian biology/landscape fragmentation study.

## All of Ed Tufte's books for some reason, 2/10

![3](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_3.jpg)

_Note: Bill remains on [Tufte's Twitter block list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/186333465) as of this writing._

## 1996 geopolitics textbook about . . . now, 4/10

![4](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_4.jpg)

Somehow fails to mention Putin, Trump, Pandemics, Beyonc√©. Predictions are hard, I get it.

## Stats programming textbooks, 3/10

![5a](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_5a.jpg)
![5b](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_5b.jpg)

You know what the world needs less of? Proprietary versions of data analysis programming languages that today offer flourishing and dominant open-source implementations. 

## Open source GIS textbook, 11/10

![6a](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_6a.jpg)
![6b](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_6b.jpg)

A decade-old #foss4g textbook by [Gary Sherman](https://spatialgalaxy.net/), who is my absolute hero for printing the term "Green-beaked Freak". The book holds up surprisingly well, with a still-applicable intro to PostGIS.

## Little red book, 1/0

![7](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_7.jpg)

Jeez, how did that get in there?

## Internet map, 7/10

![8](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_8.jpg)

A printed copy of the XKCD 2010 map of online communities. Much remains accurate; Facebook still controlling too much territory, tech blogs still largely on the proto-libertarian side of the Bay of Flame.

## Watercolor, 14/10

![9](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_9.jpg)

The most amazing use of newsprint by Stamen, Nathaniel Vaughn Kelso & co. Still one of the best examples of map tiles making it out into the real world.

## Scholarly articles, 7/10

![10](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_10.jpg)

Old school satellite imagery classification papers. Maximum likelihood! Single-layer neural nets! Algorithms from before the fall of the Berlin Wall! 

## The original AVHRR paper, 12/10

![11](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_11.jpg)

The coarsest-resolution map of the world! Talk what smack you want about 1-degree grid cells - You can't beat the radiometric consistency, or the fact that all pixels and bands fit on half a burned CD-ROM. I would have filled the rest with OutKast MP3s.

## Annals, 3/10

![12](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_12.jpg)

759 hard copy issues of The Professional Geographer and The Annals of the AAG. I think I only held onto them this long out of intense guilt about how many trees went into this.

On that note . . .

## Scenarios, 0/10

![13](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_13.jpg)

Printed summaries and emissions scenarios from the IPCC 2001 report. Printed. On hundreds of pages. And distributed so broadly that an undergrad got his hands on them.

## To serve man, 1/10

![14](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_14.jpg)

ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE. Predates Marie Tharp and common decency.

## Bibles, 15/10

![15](/shoals/assets/img/2022-03-09_15.jpg)

I still reference these all the damn time. 

Thanks for following along folks! Tune in next week for an exciting look through my high school yearbook! [Is dragged off stage in a straightjacket]
