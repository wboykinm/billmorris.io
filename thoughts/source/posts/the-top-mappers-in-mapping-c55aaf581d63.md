A longform, possibly-gendered followfriday

The Free and Open Source Software For Geospatial (FOSS4G) conference is wrapping up in Portland as I write, and as usual the sessions (viewed from afar) have been enlightening, and the community has been as engaging and open as I’ve some to expect. However, in photos the community appears to be . . . unbalanced.

Yup. 87% men at FOSS4G 2014. This is not a new problem, and one might have hoped for more progress in the shadow of the tech industry’s larger gender issues. In any case, I got to thinking about the female mappers I know and how they might expand their numbers and influence in the FOSS4G sphere; I started prepping a #FF tweet. Then I remembered Neko Case:

And in that spirit I have put together a list of mappers who do cool shit. I have compiled an inexhaustive catalog of geographers/geodevs/cartonerds whose work I admire and who drive me forward. I have counted the innovators who can inspire everyone in the industry, the ones whose github commits I use as references, the ones whose blog posts I bookmark.

### Then I pulled all the dudes off of that list. You can read about them in lots of other places.

Here then is an abridged and not-even-remotely-comprehensive group of the mappers of mapping, in no particular order. You should follow them all.
