<p>On CyberMonday I ordered one of those custom-printed phone case thingies because Google ran a hard sell. Can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
<p>Hmmm . . . looks like it shipped. Lemme check the status.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.gif" alt="1"></p>
<p>Holy hell, it&rsquo;s a map! It shows where my phone case is!</p>
<p><img src="images/2.gif" alt="2"></p>
<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s currently in . . . Shenzhen! Sweet! This is already a clearer window into the supply chain than what I&rsquo;m accustomed to . . .</p>
<p><img src="images/3.gif" alt="3"></p>
<p>Oh man, it must be at one of those massive factories I&rsquo;ve been obliquely-misinformed about since I was 5. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.gif" alt="4"></p>
<p>Hmmm . . . seems like a huge building, but it&rsquo;s closer to the city center than I&rsquo;d expect. let&rsquo;s see what it looks like on a satellite view.</p>
<p>[Whoa - that <a href="https://geoawesomeness.com/eo-hub/china-messing-gps-coordinates/">state-imposed offset</a> is no joke.]</p>
<p>But that building looks suspiciously Hall-of-the-People-ish.</p>
<p><img src="images/5.gif" alt="5"></p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s check streetview to see this factor- OH MY GOD IT&rsquo;S THE FRIGGIN&rsquo; &lsquo;NAUVOO&rsquo; FROM &lsquo;THE EXPANSE&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Takes a deep breath</em></p>
<p>Actually I see this is indeed the &ldquo;Shenzhen People&rsquo;s Government&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="images/6.gif" alt="6"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the factory. I think it&rsquo;s what the Google Maps API considers the &ldquo;default&rdquo; geocode for Shenzhen, and no address of the factory was provided to the part of the package-tracking app that faces me.</p>
<p>But man, now I want to know more about Shenzhen.</p>
<h2 id="side-trip-to-shenzhen">Side trip to Shenzhen<a href="#side-trip-to-shenzhen" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>As a dumbass American, I know f***-all about China in general, and Shenzhen in particular, but I harbor a fascination about where so much of my &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; comes from.</p>
<p>So lemme dig into this a bit.</p>
<p>Shenzhen is the beat of a great many journalists, and Matt Rivers from CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/19/shenzhen-china-innovation.cnn-business">has a good starting point</a>.</p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population in 1980: 40k</li>
<li>Population in 2018: 12 Million 😲</li>
</ul>
<p>(Cause: Deng Xiaoping&rsquo;s economic reforms, among others)</p>
<p>Shenzhen is home to many of China&rsquo;s (and the world&rsquo;s) titans of tech: Tencent, ZTE, Huawei . . . and of course, Foxconn. This last company may be known to Americans as &ldquo;That place that probably made your iPhone where they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">put up nets</a> to stop overstressed workers throwing themselves off balconies, and where Mike Daisey decided to push the boundary between journalism and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-sad-and-infuriating-mike-daisey-case/254661/">&lsquo;making s*** up&rsquo;.</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google has modest offices in Shenzhen too, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be where my phone case was manufactured, any more than the People&rsquo;s Government complex would have been. Instead, it probably would have been in a place like this manufacturing district North of the city center, where (if dubiously-curated map labels are to be believed) Foxconn has its primary facility . .</p>
<p><img src="images/7.gif" alt="7"></p>
<p>. . . and where - I s*** you not - there are precisely 0 Streetview shots or geotagged photos within a mile or so radius.</p>
<p><img src="images/8.gif" alt="8"></p>
<p>So maybe Google - currently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18117400/google-china-petitions-dragonfly-sundar-pichai">in the political weeds in China</a> - isn&rsquo;t the best source of a ground-level view of where my phone case was made. Let&rsquo;s try Baidu. Aaaaaand . . . let&rsquo;s enjoy this attempt of mine to navigate an obvious ripoff of the Google Maps UI, using only geographic cues because I have absolutely no knowledge of Chinese characters.</p>
<p><img src="images/9.gif" alt="9"></p>
<p>Lets see if Baidu has to adhere to the same precision degradation of satellite imagery as foreign map providers . . . NOPE. Spot-on.</p>
<p><img src="images/10.gif" alt="10"></p>
<p>I bet the Baidu &ldquo;Total View&rdquo; is also in better shape here . . .</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><img src="images/11.gif" alt="11"></p>
<p>This part of Shenzhen is basically all-Foxconn, as far as the eye can see, but I suppose it&rsquo;s not a bad answer to &ldquo;What is it like where my phone case comes from?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="images/12.gif" alt="12"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that a corporate behemoth like Baidu is like the friendly guy on the corner who gives you detailed directions and recommends a good teahouse . . . but maybe local knowledge is better when running down a whim of curiosity in unfamiliar territory. A harder class of question to answer is what I&rsquo;m really after here: questions about the people who live and work here. Like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What did the worker who QA&rsquo;d my phone case do for fun last weekend? [Did she even have a day off?]&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And not to harp too much on Mike Daisey (his transgressions now seem quaint in the era of a president who capital-L-Lies on the daily), but his &ldquo;Heart of Darkness&rdquo; approach to talking about tech in Shenzhen is both odious and relatable. Here I am, across the planet from this place where my phone case was birthed, curious about the circumstances that surround the creation of that little bit of plastic that&rsquo;ll spend so much time in my pocket. And despite the fact that I have an information bonanza available to me about Shenzhen at the stroke of a key - in English, no less - I still feel the cloak of mystery swirling back around that faraway city even moments after I stop researching it.</p>
<p>Maybe I should visit 😎.</p>
<h2 id="the-phone-moves-out">The phone moves out<a href="#the-phone-moves-out" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>UPDATE! OFF TO OSAKA!</p>
<p><img src="images/13.gif" alt="13"></p>
<p>UPDATE: Hello, Louisville!</p>
<p><img src="images/14.gif" alt="14"></p>
<p>Also, big shout to Google Maps&rsquo; recently-imposed and not-yet-addressed-by-the-tracking-app <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2018/05/07/agents-will-have-to-really-start-paying-for-google-maps/">API requirements!</a> I&rsquo;d like to think that my aggressive package-tracking is what caused the API limit bots to notice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fail to note that my phone case passed through Anchorage, probably well before today&rsquo;s earthquake. But these arrows sure have the hint of a pilot approaching the airport, noticing fissures opening up in the earth, and cruising away like Cusak &amp; co. in &ldquo;2012&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="images/15.gif" alt="15"></p>
<p>UPDATE: Swerve North to Indianapolis!</p>
<p><img src="images/16.gif" alt="16"></p>
<p>UPDATE: On Springfield! On White River Junction! On . . . hey wait, did this chain of custody already forget its brush with disaster in Anchorage? Has the memory of Osaka faded?</p>
<p>Was Shenzhen merely a dream?</p>
<p><img src="images/17.gif" alt="17"></p>
<p>Nashua? NO WAIT COME BACK THAT&rsquo;S THE WRONG WAY.</p>
<p><img src="images/18.gif" alt="18"></p>
<p>Really going for the &ldquo;Lopsided scarecrow&rdquo; look here . . .</p>
<p><img src="images/19.gif" alt="19"></p>
<p>. . . but at long last, the package has entered the city limits of Burlington, VT.</p>
<h2 id="the-arrival">The arrival<a href="#the-arrival" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Mailbox . . .</p>
<p><img src="images/20.jpg" alt="20"></p>
<p>Unbox . . .</p>
<p><img src="images/21.gif" alt="21"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s glorious! And it&rsquo;s a map 😀</p>
<p><img src="images/22.gif" alt="22"></p>
<p>. . . specifically, a map of my home region, centered on the great city of Burlington. I made it using Mapbox Studio, because Google&rsquo;s default cartography for these &ldquo;place cases&rdquo; is uninspiring. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/obz6pis07iupz4x/champlain.png?dl=0">Here&rsquo;s the static image for download</a> for all the Champlain-ers out there.</p>
<p>This magical unsealing of what-was-last-sealed-by-the-banks-of-the-Sham-Chun-river brings me back to why I started on this thread in the first place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did the lineworker in Shenzhen who checked this case think for a moment about the faraway, frankly-obscure place depicted on it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I doubt it, and can hardly blame her; Americans like me are fond of placing ourselves at the center of everyone else&rsquo;s imagined worldviews. But the odd whims of a global economy have caused me to send a map of my home to the other side of the world for printing, then very slowly back to live in my pocket. I&rsquo;ll keep thinking about those who saw it along the way.</p>

<p>I should note that the &ldquo;Humans of the global supply chain&rdquo; tale has been expertly told by many able investigators at this point, notably Alex Blumberg <a href="https://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title">back when he was at Planet Money</a>.</p>
<p>I should also note that Vince Staples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz9-pXuvFEU">already dunked hard</a> on the genre of StreetView-curiosity-tourism I&rsquo;m practicing here, and it&rsquo;s glorious.</p>
