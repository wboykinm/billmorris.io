        <p>To take my mind off certain things, I’ve been experimenting with a novel style of cartography: <strong>cubism</strong>.</p>
<p>I arrived here on a wave of hype via an app called <a href="http://prisma-ai.com/">Prisma</a> — a nifty take on the “filter-and-share” photo paradigm; it applies a touch of machine learning to redraw your image in an array of artistic styles. You’ve <em>definitely</em> seen the results in the wild, sometimes stunning, sometimes godawful, usually determined by the quality of the source image.</p>
<p>After fiddling with the app for a few weeks and finding its limitations, on a whim I tried piping a satellite image through it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And <em>it worked</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With some minor adjustments, the landscape structure punched through the style while looking completely abstract — a memory of the stone walls and crops in the fields of Northern France:</p>
<p><img src="images/4.jpeg" alt="croplands">
<em>Fields in Luyères, France</em></p>
<p>Aided by <a href="https://www.planet.com/gallery/">a trove of openly-licensed imagery</a> from the ever-generous <a href="https://twitter.com/planetlabs">Planet Labs</a>, I started abstracting sites worldwide. I was particularly drawn to a pair of styles that drew from the work of the French avant-garde polymath <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/francis-picabia">Francis Picabia</a>. His large-scale pieces — and cubism more broadly — fit almost perfectly into the structure of the human-altered landscapes we can see from space. The deconstructionist tendency of cubism — break it apart and then piece it roughly back together — mirrors the patterns visible in agriculture and the built environment. We break apart the ground at all scales, and we put it back together, repurposed; human straightaways against nature’s arcs and bights.</p>

<p>But using Prisma felt limiting very quickly. First was the simple issue of it being a black box — there’s no indication of the parameters used to tune the model, nowhere to include weights or adjustments. Second — and more of a practical problem — was the fact that prisma outputs at a maximum image size of 1080px wide, which is mostly unsuitable for printing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Prisma — at least as far as I can tell — is simply a consumer-friendly wrapper built on an excellent open-source toolkit by Justin Johnson called <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style">Neural Style</a>. Relatively straightforward to implement on a laptop (or wherever, <a href="https://medium.com/@lherrera/how-to-fake-it-as-an-artist-with-docker-aws-and-deep-learning-6d42f4acd890#.s8962978z">from a Docker container</a>), the software invokes a <a href="https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/">convolutional neural network</a> to <em>understand</em> the structure and style of the inputs before doing its best to aggregate them.</p>

<p>After some configuration struggles (<a href="http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/NVDA-Quote">NVIDIA is so hot right now</a>, but man their GPU drivers are sometimes painful to use), I began making these images on my own server, free from the Prisma TOU and scale. <a href="https://github.com/wboykinm/neural-style-docker">My current implementation of the code</a> is now stocked with satellite imagery. There are endless possibilities.</p>
<p>I am not an artist; I make these pieces with some of my own sensibility expressed as a series of command line arguments — switches and weights. I’m amalgamating the true work that undergirds it: the paintcraft of Picabia, the code of Justin Johnson, the scientists who built the neural network, and the orbiting satellites of Planet Labs (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMZiUIHhMDK/?taken-by=wboykinm">and USGS</a>, so far). But in a way, this is meta-cubism: aided by machines, I am pulling apart composed materials and putting them back together, slightly rearranged. I would hope that this would raise at least a smirk from Picabia before he would throw a drink in my face.</p>
