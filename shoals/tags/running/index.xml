      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year it&amp;rsquo;s harder than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My right knee has been bothering me since last summer, after some particularly long and brutal trail runs, after 100 miles of backpacking, after . . . maybe something I don&amp;rsquo;t even recall. It started quiet and progressed to a yell walking up and down stairs by Thanksgiving. The results of my MRI are now in, and it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to hear them with dramatic music playing in the background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Chondrosis, with cartilage fissuring and bone edema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/knee.png&#34; alt=&#34;The knee in question&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best translation I&amp;rsquo;ve got is that &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve ruined my knee in a way that won&amp;rsquo;t heal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one clear message I&amp;rsquo;m getting from everyone - physicians, runners, bloggers, running doctor bloggers - is that I should all but stop running. This isn&amp;rsquo;t garden-variety arthritis; this is &lt;em&gt;damage&lt;/em&gt;, and I should find a new sport with lower impact, to extend the life of my knee before a now-inevitable replacement. So, like several billion of my middle-aged brethren before me, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to adjust - try to make a go of it with cycling or rowing or quietly reading. But that hurts, because running, to me, is perfect. All you need is a pair of shoes, and you can do it anywhere in the world, in any conditions. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss it like I&amp;rsquo;d miss home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the dangerous position of being able to construct multiple narratives about my life as a runner. If I squint and tilt my head one way, I see a late-blooming enthusiasm that led me to start piling up miles and &lt;em&gt;seriousness&lt;/em&gt; even before a pandemic made it the perfect manic coping strategy. If I tilt the other way, I read a story of a little fat kid who showed up to track practice one day; whose coach - Tim Simpson, bless you - didn&amp;rsquo;t laugh him off the field but instead got him moving; of someone who&amp;rsquo;s been running ever since. Both narratives are &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo;, but both are coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get to work on a new story.&lt;/p&gt;
