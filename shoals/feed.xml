        <title>Perception and reality</title>
        <description>
          In which I fall into a well-documented trap of my [our] own devising. - 
          I was at an amazing conference last week. The combination of a great setting, a warm and welcoming crowd - and a novel format that had us outdoors as much as we were in - led to a feeling of progress and connection that I don‚Äôt often get at events...

        <title>Dryland XYZ tiles</title>
        <description>
          In which I discover how much geoprocessing you can get done with inline SQLite - 
          Mapbox is occasionally referred to - not uncharitably - as ‚ÄúThe Tile Company‚Äù. It‚Äôs true; we deal with big amounts of data, and the most common map/reduce unit we use is the old standby Mercator/XYZ tile. My past and present colleagues have built some really cool tools to make these...

        <description>
          A message in a bottle (or a laminated bar menu) - 
          Yesterday a friend asked for my help hauling his boat closer to shore, along Lake Champlain in the Northern part of town. The recent flooding elsewhere in Vermont had now reached the lake, and he was worried that the rising waters would carry off his summer recreation plans. So I...

        <description>
          Can tragedy fade into the background when it&apos;s on your doorstep? - 
          Summer is great. I keep forgetting this, but the shores of Lake Champlain - for a blessed few months every year - are an absolute paradise. As I biked with my son to his summer camp this morning, I saw it in full display: boats on the water, strolling couples,...

        <title>Once a cyclist</title>
        <description>
          A short history of the author on two wheels. - 
          Now that I‚Äôve been forced to ditch running, I‚Äôve started cycling. Late in a Vermont winter, this has meant ponying up for a trainer attachment, plugging my old cross bike into it, and trying my damndest to occupy exactly the same workout schedule, but now with spins instead of paces....

        <description>
          
          It‚Äôs late winter. I still run in the dark, though I get traces of dawn now. Surfaces are ice, the wind blows viciously, and my miles get slower and slower. This is always a hard time of year to be a runner. This year it‚Äôs harder than ever. My right...

          Y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve wandered over to Mastodon from Twitter, along with a goodly number of other folks from the broad geo-sphere, and it‚Äôs . . . nice. Feel easier to post random musings. Less motive, less image. But I rolled back over to Twitter right quick when I wanted to get...

        <title>Adventures of a smartwatch in Paris [UPDATE: MYSTERY SOLVED]</title>
        <description>
          In which I learn a thing or two about novel GPS errors. - 
          One day this past July, I got up early and started a long run around Paris. I‚Äôve found this practice to be the easiest way to explore without being an insufferable tourist. As I usually do, I started tracking the run with my Garmin Forerunner 245 watch. (Follow along using...

          Greenhead I told everyone who asked that I slept well. It wasn‚Äôt really true; the room was well-heated and there‚Äôs nothing but a comforter, reinforcing the fact that I sleep best in the cold. On the flip side, it‚Äôs impossible to complain because thanks to the over-powered heaters, every scrap...

          When any of us have a job that requires courage, and the winds are blowing against us, what will we do? - 
          On November 9, 1938, Goebbels turned the SA loose on Jewish communities throughout Germany, in a pogrom now known as Kristallnacht. With the veneer of a ‚Äúpopular, spontaneous uprising‚Äù, nazis smashed Jewish business, attacked Jews, and arrested them in the thousands, heralding the horrors to come. 1400 Synagogues were burned...

But we mostly use SQL. SQL is...

          Psych. It&apos;s actually a meek defense. - 
          We, the data-folk of Faraday, agree wholeheartedly with our colleagues at Carto on this sensitive issue: In the USA, ZIP codes(‚Ñ¢) are the worst-case scenario base unit for measuring geospatial relationships. Because: They‚Äôre widely-varying in size &amp;amp; shape They contain populations that range from 0 into the hundreds of thousands...
